# Build on top of garf

While `garf` provides you with a lot of built-in functionality it might not be
sufficient for an API of your choice.

To make `garf` work with your API explore options below:

* [Create an API client](create-api-client.md) to be used with `ApiReportFetcher` class.
* [Create an API response parser](create-api-response-parser.md) to be customize how `ApiReportFetcher` parses response from API.
* [Create a library](create-garf-library.md) and expose it as `garf` plugin.
