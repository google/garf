# Get Started

Garf allows you to define SQL-like queries alongside aliases and custom extractors and specify where the results of such query should be stored.
Based on such a query the library constructs the correct query to a reporting API of your choice, automatically extract all necessary fields from API schema
and transform them into a structure suitable for writing data.
